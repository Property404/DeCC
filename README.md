# DeCC

I enjoy subtitles, but I don't particularly like seeing "[SUSPENSFUL MUSIC]" or
"[SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]". For those like me, you can use DeCC to remove
closed-captioning elements from SRT files.

## Usage

```bash
decc input.srt output.srt

# Or, to modify in-place.
decc input.srt
```

## TODO

* Directly modify subtitles in mkv, mp4, etc
* Make things better
